# Honeywell HSC I2C Connector

I developed this as most of what I saw out there was made connector Honeywell
sensor through an Andrino board. I was hard for me to find direct reference to 
access Honeywell Sensor direct to Raspberry PI

In my case I have tested this script using a "HSCSANN100PA2A5" with a Raspberry 
PI 3.

See example.py for usage.
